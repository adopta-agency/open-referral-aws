<p>This is the schema for the HSDS format. It is available as an HTML list, JSON schema, as well as a YAML version of the schema, for different uses. If you are looking for a machine readable definition for the HSDS API, there is <a href="/api/">a separate OpenAPI Spec available for the project</a>.</p>
