title: 'Open Referral AWS'
---

<p>This is the project for develop Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) implementations that run on the Amazon Web Services platform. All work on projects that run on AWS will be coordinated here on this site that runs on Github.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Services</strong></p>
<p>The services that are needed to run an HSDS API on AWS:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> - A Linux Amazon EC2 instance that runs Apache, with PHP 5.3 that runs the API.</li>
  <li><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> - A MySQL Amazon RDS instance that runs the database behind the API.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong></p>
<p>The tooling that is used as part of delivering this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI Specification</strong> - An API specification format used to define the request and response model for the API.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS PHP Prototype</strong> - A current set of PHP scripts that is deployed to support the API.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>The communication channels used as part of this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Github Issues</strong> - A Linux Amazon EC2 instance that runs Apache, with PHP 5.3 that runs the API.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Referral Slack</strong> - A MySQL Amazon RDS instance that runs the database behind the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop code and stories around using HSDS on the AWS platform. Right now we are focusing on a simple implementation, but will be looking at serverless approaches using Amazon Lamda services, as well as management using Amazon API Gateway.</p>
