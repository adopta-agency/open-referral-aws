title: 'Open Referral AWS'
---

<p>This is the project for develop Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) implementations that run on the Amazon Web Services platform. All work on projects that run on AWS will be coordinated here on this site that runs on Github.</p>
<p>First, what services are needed to run an HSDS API on AWS:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> - A Linux Amazon EC2 instance that runs Apache, with PHP 5.3 that runs the API.</li>
  <li><strong>Amazon RDS</strong> - A MySQL Amazon RDS instance that runs the database behind the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other</p>
