title: 'Open Referral AWS'
---

<p>This is a project for developing Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) implementations that run on the Amazon Web Services platform--this project is entirely managed via <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-aws">its Github repository</a>. This is designed to be a team effort, so if you see a project you'd like to know more about, and maybe one you'd like to tackle, submit an issue!</p>

<p><strong>AWS Services</strong></p>
<p>These are the AWS solutions that are currently being used or considered as part of delivering projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon EC2</strong></a> - A Linux Amazon EC2 instance that runs Apache, with PHP 5.3 that runs the API.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon RDS</strong></a> - A MySQL Amazon RDS instance that runs the database behind the API.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong></a> - This isn't currently being used, but I would like to use for delivering an API management layer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Lambda</strong></a> - Just putting this here as a reference for what should come, when we are doing this in a serverless way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong></p>
<p>These are tools that are used as across any of the sub-projects included in this project.:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.openapis.org/" target="_blank"><strong>OpenAPI Specification</strong></a> - An API specification format used to define the request and response model for the API.</li>
  <li><a href="http://json-schema.org/" target="_blank"><strong>JSON Schema</strong></a> - A vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.</li>
  <li><a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/" target="_blank"><strong>HSDS OpenAPI</strong></a> - The OpenAPI definition for the HSDS API, providing a blueprint for the request and response structure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://openreferral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/#objects-and-fields" target="_blank"><strong>HSDS Schema</strong></a> - The schema documentation for HSDS, providing the details of the storage and transmission of data.</li>  
  <li><a href="https://www.slimframework.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Slim Framework</strong></a> - A micro framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> - A simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
<p>These are the individual projects that are being built, or considered being built on AWS:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api" target="_blank"><strong>HSDS PHP API Prototype</strong></a> (Github) - A current set of PHP scripts that is deployed to support the API.</li>
  <li><a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/" target="_blank"><strong>Developer Portal (PHP Prototype)</strong></a> - A Github Pages hosted Jeykll developer portal developed on top of the HSDS PHP API prototype.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Node.js API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Node.js, that would run on AWS.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Ruby API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Ruby, that would run on AWS.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS Python API Prototype</strong></a> - It would be nice to have a server side implementation of the HSDS API in Python, that would run on AWS.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDS API (Serverless)</strong></a> - I would like someone to explore with the creation of an HSDS API running using AWS Lambda, and AWS Gateway.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>These are the communication channels used as part of this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-aws/issues" target="_blank">Github Issues</strong></a> - This is the Github issues for this repository, which is used as issue and discussion management for any HSDS AWS project -- each project will have it's own issues, but this is meant to be the discussion at the top level.</li>
  <li><a href="https://openreferral.slack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Open Referral Slack</strong></a> - The Slack Channel for the Open Referral organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop code and stories around using HSDS on the AWS platform. Right now we are focusing on a simple server-side API implementation, but will be looking at serverless approaches using Amazon Lamda services, as well as management using Amazon API Gateway.</p>
<p>If you have a suggestion for a project, or want to get involved with any of the existing projects, just ping us on one of the channels above, and we'll see about getting you plugged in.
